# Manual Push Instructions

Since git commands aren't working through the IDE, please use VS Code's UI:

## Method 1: VS Code Source Control
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+G` to open Source Control
2. You should see all your changed files listed
3. Click the `+` button next to "Changes" to stage all files
4. Enter commit message: `feat: plugin manager system replaces sidebar`
5. Click the checkmark to commit
6. Click "Sync Changes" or "Push" button

## Method 2: External Terminal
1. Open Windows Terminal or Command Prompt (NOT in VS Code)
2. Run: `cd d:\Codedswitchmonatize`
3. Run: `git add -A`
4. Run: `git commit -m "feat: plugin manager system"`
5. Run: `git push origin main`

## What's Ready to Deploy
- Plugin Manager system created
- Sidebar replaced with single "Plugin Manager" entry
- All 20+ tools converted to activatable plugins
- Melody Composer V2 included in plugin system
- Categories: Studio, Production, Analysis, Utility

The code is ready - it just needs to reach GitHub to trigger Render rebuild.
